# Pomodore

In this project, I built a pomodore timer with HTML, CSS and Javascript. A pomodore timer helps you to stay focused on your task for a chosen period of time. Usually, the timer is set to 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5 minute break and can be repeated as long as you wish. 

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project),
an open source and free online curricum to learn web development.

## Functionalities
- Press play, pause, stop, or refresh to set your timer
- Set how long the sessions and breaks should be
- Visual distinguishment between pauses and sessions
- When the timer is up, an meditative audio sound is played

## Challenges
There were a couple of challenges during programming this app:
- I got to get used to the setIntervall() function
- I had to figure out how to get the relationship between seconds and minutes right
- Programming the change between pauses and breaks
- Applying the settings the user can set
